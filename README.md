# RobotAllotment

A program that map of plants you want to grow in an alloted space and processes raw data about the environment.

Ideal outcome of the project is to have a GUI that allows you to input certain fruit and vegetables you want to grow as well as amount and size of the allotment. From here the algorithm will create a visualisation of your allotment and creates objects according to the plants. 

The second phase is to attach arduino sensors to a cpu and have it send data about rain, sunlight, height of plants etc back to the database so the plants growth can be monitored. It would also taken in data from local weather forecasts in the area. 

So far the visualisation of the allotment works in a simple python script and creates the image using TKinter. 

All the main interface functionality has been designed and planned but not all the functions for the buttons have been written. 

The second phase has not yet started, although I have planned the sensors and data that will be taken in.
